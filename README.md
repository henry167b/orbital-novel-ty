Motivation

NLB has a great service in providing books for the general public, but their main website/app has several limitations that may hinder the user experience. Currently their mobile application has a confusing interface that results in poor user navigability. For example, the core functionalities of the applications are hard to access. This is also evidenced by the poor user reviews on both the Google Playstore and the Apple App Store.

For most people, they would want to maximise their time and go to a single library within close proximity and borrow the most amount of books possible. If you have a large wishlist, it will be time consuming to look through each book individually to find the availability and then record it down elsewhere to keep track of the library which contains the most books in your wishlist.

If you are just looking for a nearby library to study, you would want to go to the library that has sufficient space. However, it is not uncommon to make your way to the library and not find seats. Even if there are empty seats, the current seat-booking system that NLB has means that you will not be able to occupy that seat if it has been booked.

Aim

We hope to make an all-in-one integrated mobile application that has core functionalities that caters to all NLB users and is easy to use.

User Stories

As a frequent book borrower, I want to be able to search based on my entire reading list and determine which location has the most number of books so as to optimise my trip

As a student, I want to be able to see the real time traffic at the library studying area to avoid making an unnecessary trip if the area is overcrowded

As a book borrower, I would like the app to have a dashboard where I keep track of my current borrow list and send me notifications when my loan period is ending soon
